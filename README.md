# Hamro Lunch Box

Restaurant ordering and operations app arranged as a small full-stack monorepo. The frontend is React + Vite, the API is Express, and MySQL schema/configuration live in `database/` and `backend/`.

## Project structure

```text
frontend/                 React application and Vite configuration
  src/                    Pages, components, and shared UI constants
  nginx.conf              Reverse proxy used by the production image
backend/                  Express API
  src/config/              MySQL connection pool
  src/routes/              API route handlers
database/                  MySQL schema and future migrations
```

## Setup

### Docker (full stack)

Copy the example environment file, set strong passwords, and start everything:

```powershell
copy .env.docker.example .env
docker compose up -d --build
```

Open `http://localhost:8080` (change the port with `APP_PORT`). Compose creates MySQL, applies `database/schema.sql` on first start, builds the API and the nginx-served frontend, and wires them together on an internal network. Only the frontend publishes a host port.

### Local development

Install workspace dependencies from the project root:

```powershell
npm install
```

Create the local MySQL database using `database/schema.sql`, then copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env` and set the local database credentials (`DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_NAME`) plus the first `ADMIN_USERNAME` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` / `ADMIN_NAME`. Start the API and frontend in separate terminals:

```powershell
npm run dev:backend
npm run dev
```

The API listens on `http://localhost:3000`; `GET /api/health` checks the MySQL connection and returns 503 when the database is unreachable. The frontend runs on Vite's usual `http://localhost:5173` address and proxies `/api` to the API, so the browser only ever talks to one origin. Production frontend builds use `npm run build` and produce `frontend/dist`.

## Data and auth behavior

The frontend is fully connected to the API: it loads state from `GET /api/business` and autosaves with `PUT /api/business`. All business data lives in the MySQL `business_state` table as a single JSON document guarded by a `revision` counter (concurrent saves get `409 Conflict` and must reload). Nothing is stored in browser local storage, so clearing browser data does not remove saved records; use the in-app backup export instead.

Authentication is cookie based (`hlb_session`, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Strict`, 12-hour lifetime) against the `users` and `sessions` tables, with scrypt password hashing. Roles are enforced server side: `reception` cannot manage accounts, and `delivery` can only read its own orders and change their status or payments.

The API has no CORS middleware by design — it is meant to be reached through the Vite dev proxy or the nginx reverse proxy on the same origin.

## Accounts

There are no seeded or demo logins. The first administrator is created at API startup from `ADMIN_USERNAME` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` (minimum 12 characters) in the environment. Every other account is created by an administrator in Settings → Accounts, with a temporary password handed over out of band.

| Role | Access |
|---|---|
| Admin | Everything, including account management |
| Reception | Orders, billing, inventory, reports; no account management |
| Delivery | Only orders assigned to that driver |

## Deployment notes

`docker compose` is the supported deployment path and serves frontend and API from one origin. `vercel.json` produces a static frontend build only: its rewrite sends every path to `index.html` and there is no `/api` route, so a static-only host will render the UI but every API call will fail unless you add a rewrite from `/api/*` to a separately hosted backend. When serving the API behind HTTPS, set `COOKIE_SECURE=true` so session cookies carry the `Secure` flag.

VAT is optional and disabled by default. The app does not connect to IRD/CBMS and is not presented as IRD-listed e-billing software.
